        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <h2>Background and Personal Life</h2>
        <p>
          I'm an Asian American, born and raised in Colorado. My family is
          originally from Vietnam, I have 1 older sister and a cute Maltipoo. I
          love to golf, hike, camp, cruise, and i just like being outside
          soaking up the rays.
          <p>
            When you can't find me outside, I'm probably binge watching shows,
            cooking, or playing PC games.
          </p>
        </p>
        <h2>A professional perspective</h2>
        <p>
          I love meeting new people and working in a positive team atmosphere, i
          learn so much from others than a youTube video. We all come from
          different walks of life and have different knowledge, skills, and
          abilities.
          <p>
            I truly believe that if we all work together, we can achieve
            anything we want while we become family and connect with one
            another.
